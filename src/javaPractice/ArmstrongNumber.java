		 * Question 4: Write a Java Program to check if a number is Armstrong number or
		 * not. Solution 4: An Armstrong Number is a number in which the sum of the
		 * cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. For ex:
		 * 
		 * 371 = 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1
		 * 
		 * The sum of the cubes is 3,7,1 is equal to 371.Another example is 153 which is
		 * an Armstrong number. You can explore other numbers too!!!
		 * 
		 * Below is the Java Program to check the number is Armstrong or not.
		 * 
		 * @param args

			int n = actualnum % 10;
			result = result + Math.pow(n, 3);
			actualnum = actualnum / 10;
		}

		if (result == num) {
			System.out.println(num + " is an Armstrong number");
		} else {
			System.out.println(num + " is not an Armstrong number");
